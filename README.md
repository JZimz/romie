# ROMie

ROMie helps you import, organize, and sync your ROM libraries to portable retro gaming devices. Create custom playlists (tags) of your favorite games and sync them to your device's SD card. ROMie automatically handles the correct folder structure for your device.

## Features

- **ROM Library Management** - Import and organize your ROM collections
- **Device Sync** - Copy ROMs to your handheld with the correct folder structure
- **Playlist System** - Create custom collections with tags
- **ROM Verification** - MD5 hash matching against RetroAchievements database
- **Smart Naming** - Normalize filenames to proper game titles
- **Achievement Tracking** - View your RetroAchievements progress for verified ROMs

## Supported Device Operating Systems
Each handheld operating system organizes ROMs differently. ROMie uses device profiles to handle this automatically. They're essentially system-to-folder mappings that ensure your ROMs end up in the right place on your device.

- **OnionOS** (MiyooMini+)
- **Knulli** (Universal)
- **muOS** (MustardOS)
- **ROCKNIX** (Various handhelds)
- **Custom** - Create your own device profile

1. Download the latest release for your platform
2. Launch ROMie and import your ROM folder
3. Create playlists by tagging your favorite games
4. Select your device profile and SD card location
5. Hit sync - your ROMs are copied with the right folder structure
